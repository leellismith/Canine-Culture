## Heroku Deployment
[Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/) was used for The Canine Culture project. Heroku is a cloud platform that allows developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.

To deploy your own, follow these steps -

>1. Select __New__ in the top-right corner of your Heroku Dashboard, and select __Create new app__ from the dropdown menu.
>2. Your app name must be unique, and then choose a region closest to you (EU or USA), and finally, select __Create App__.
>3. From the new app __Settings__, click __Reveal Config Vars__, and set your environment variables.

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | user's own value |
| `IP` | 0.0.0.0 |
| `MONGO_DBNAME` | user's own value |
| `MONGO_URI` | user's own value |
| `PORT` | 5000 |
| `SECRET_KEY` | user's own value |

>4. Heroku needs two additional files in order to deploy properly.
- requirements.txt
- Procfile

>5. You can install this project's __requirements__ (where applicable) using:

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

>6. If you have your own packages that have been installed, then the requirements file needs updated using:

- `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`

>7. The **Procfile** can be created with the following command:

- `echo web: python app.py > Procfile`
- *replace __app.py__ with the name of your primary Flask app name; the one at the root-level*

NOTE: The Procfile uses a capital P and doesn't have a file extension on the end.

>8. For Heroku deployment, follow these steps to connect your own GitHub repository to the newly created app:

Either:

- Select __Automatic Deployment__ from the Heroku app.

>9. Or:

- In the Terminal/CLI, connect to Heroku using this command: `heroku login -i`
- Set the remote for Heroku: `heroku git:remote -a app_name` (replace *app_name* with your app name)
- After performing the standard Git `add`, `commit`, and `push` to GitHub, you can now type:
	- `git push heroku main`

The project should now be connected and deployed to Heroku!

>1. Go to github.
>2. Find Canine-Culture repository or [Click Here](https://github.com/leellismith/Canine-Culture).
>3. Click on the green <> Code button.

>5. Load up [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/)
>6. Once logged in, Select Orange new workspace button.
